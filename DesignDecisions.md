Chess Engine Initial Design Decisions
=====================================

This document details the initial design decisions made for this chess
engine.

The decisions were made based upon the following criteria:

- Performance
- Simplicity

In general I erred on the side of simplicity for this project rather
that going for maximum performance. The rationale for this is simple,
this project is predominantly for the purpose of learning how to design
and implement programs utilizing complex algorithms. I have no illusions
that this chess engine will ever compete with existing engines such as
Stockfish.
